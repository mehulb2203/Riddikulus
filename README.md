Often time, we come across various problem on the streets of Mumbai, but we are clueless as to where to report the same.
So, The System creates a portal for the same, where citizens can report their problems, and others can view,
vote and comment on the same, with respect to the status of the problem, whether it is resolved, ongoing, or gotten worse.
Apart from that,The users can also mark locations on the map, where they encountered the problem.

Here are some of the features the have been implemented -
● Lodging problems and gauge their severity or distance
● Vote, comment and view problems according to severity or distance
● Mark locations on the map, where the problem was faced, extract the ward that problem belongs to, report to the ward
● Created two separate views admin-user and citizen users.
● Display of all the place of complain in a single map view to get overall insight


Work under process:
● Incorporate some measures of authenticity in logging an issue.
  For this the system will get the location of issue and accept image, video, sound decibel (for noise pollution).
● Tracking the progress of issues logged
